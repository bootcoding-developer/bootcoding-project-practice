# Smart Locker API
The SmartLocker API project aims to develop a robust and secure API for managing smart lockers. The API will facilitate operations such as locker allocation, access control, and monitoring, providing a seamless experience for users.

## Bootcoding Project Case Study on Smart Locker API

1. Design and Implement User Authentication and Authorization APIs
   - `Sign Up`:
   Users should be able to create an account by providing necessary details.
   - `Login`:
   Registered users should be able to log in securely.
   - `Access Control`:
   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to API endpoints.
2. Design and Implement User Lockers
   - `Create Locker`:
   User should be able to create new lockers with unique identifiers.
   - `Allocate Locker`:
   Users should be able to request and allocate a locker.
   - `Release Locker`:
   Users should be able to release their allocated locker when done.
3. Notification System
   - Implement an email notification system for user activities.
   - Send Email Notification when User create New locker
   - Send Email Notification when User allocate locker
   - Send Email Notification when User release locker

### Additional Application Requirements
- Implement secure password hashing for user accounts.
- Design the pagination mechanism for retrieving a list of lockers with given capacity.
- Provide comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI. 
- Complete API source code hosted on a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
- Comprehensive documentation covering API endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.

### Identify Hidden Requirements
- Given requirements are always incomplete, so it is important to find hidden requirements or ask questions or confirm your assumptions.
- To identify hidden requirements or assumptions in the project, we need to make some hypothetical considerations based on common scenarios in the system.

### How to submit your code

**Instructions:**
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner.
